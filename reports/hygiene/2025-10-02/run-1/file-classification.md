# File Classification Report (2025-10-02)

This report provides a conservative, auditable classification of all files in the repository as of October 2, 2025. Each file is assigned to one of the following categories:

- **CORE**: Essential for build, CI, or critical logic. Only files with clear, direct evidence of necessity are classified as CORE.
- **USEFUL**: Not strictly required for build/CI, but potentially valuable (e.g., docs, configs, scripts, examples, onboarding). If uncertain, default to USEFUL.
- **LEGACY/NOISE**: Explicitly listed in FILES_LEGACY.txt or FILES_NOISE.txt, or clearly obsolete, test, or artifact files.

Each entry includes the file path, classification, risk level, and a brief rationale. See the accompanying JSON file for machine-readable evidence.
