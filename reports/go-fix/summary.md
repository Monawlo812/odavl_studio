### Remaining Manual Steps Required

#### High Priority (Blocks 100% Readiness)

1. **VS Code Marketplace Publishing**
   - Command: `cd apps/vscode-ext && vsce publish`
   - Requires: PAT with marketplace permissions
   - Guide: `reports/go-fix/vsce-publish.md`

2. **GitHub Release Creation**
   - Command: `gh release create v0.3.0-wave3-final-20250921`
   - Guide: `reports/go-fix/release-checklist.md`

#### Medium Priority (Enhances Visibility)

3. **Docker Image Publishing**
   - Command: `docker build -t ghcr.io/monawlo812/odavl-studio:0.3.0 . && docker push`
   - Requires: GHCR PAT with packages:write
   - Guide: `reports/go-fix/docker-publish.md`

4. **GitHub Pages Deployment**
   - Should auto-deploy via existing `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
   - Check: https://monawlo812.github.io/odavl_studio/

#### Low Priority (Operational Excellence)

5. **GitHub App Wide Deployment**
   - Guide: `reports/go-fix/github-app-install-checklist.md`
   - Target: Expand beyond current repositories
