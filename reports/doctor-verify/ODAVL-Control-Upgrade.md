# ODAVL Studio Extension – Control Panel & Doctor Mode Upgrade (2025-09-26)

## Summary
This upgrade delivers a professional ODAVL Studio experience in VS Code, including a modern icon, a clean Control Panel webview, robust command wiring, and an always-on Doctor Mode for automated project health.

## Changes Made
- **Professional Icon**: Replaced the old icon with a modern, circular ODAVL SVG (`media/odavl.svg`).
- **Control Panel Webview**: Implemented a dark-mode friendly, centered UI with Scan, Heal, Explain, Undo, and Reports buttons. Each button posts a message to the extension.
- **Command Wiring**: Button actions are wired to run the correct CLI or VS Code commands in the "ODAVL Doctor" terminal or open the reports folder.
- **Doctor Mode**: Added background activation and `onDidSaveTextDocument` event to auto-run the Doctor after every save. Status bar shows "Doctor: PASS ✅" or "Doctor: Issues ❌ (n)".
- **Manifest & Activation**: Updated manifest and activation logic for new view and icon.
