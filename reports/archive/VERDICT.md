# ODAVL Consolidation VERDICT

**Date:** 2025-09-27
**Canonical Repo:** `odavl__add-dispatch-20250924`
**Output Directory:** `reports/consolidation-scout/2025-09-27/`

---

## 1. Canonicalization Summary
- Canonical repo selected: `odavl__add-dispatch-20250924` (see scorecards and summary in `reports/consolidation-scout/2025-09-27/`)
- Branch created, repo context captured, and all provenance logged.

## 2. Imports and Sources
- Batch 1 imported the following (see provenance.md):
  - `tools/` from `odavl__all-in-one-20250924`
  - `examples/` from `odavl__all-in-one-20250924`
  - `.vscode/` from `odavl__all-in-one-20250924`
  - `infra/` from `odavl__bundle-gates-20250924`
  - `scripts/` from `odavl__bundle-gates-20250924`
  - `reports/novel-diagnostics/` (skipped: source missing)
- All files and subfolders in each path were imported as-is. See `provenance.md` for details.

## 3. Content Drift & Gaps
- Full content drift check performed for `.github/workflows/*` and other critical folders (see `content-drift.md`).
- All overlapping files are byte-for-byte identical; canonical repo contains additional workflow files not present in trusted sources.
- No critical or minor drift detected in compared files.
- No further imports needed (Batch 2: N/A).

## 4. Verification Results
- **pnpm install:** PASS (see `logs/verification-install.log`)
- **pnpm -w run lint:** FAIL (see `logs/verification-lint.log`)
  - Error: Workspace "@odavl/cli" from "apps/cli/package.json" already exists at "packages/cli/package.json"
- **pnpm -w run typecheck:** FILE MISSING (log not found)
- **pnpm -w run build:** FILE MISSING (log not found)

## 5. Residual Gaps / Issues
- Lint failed due to duplicate workspace package for `@odavl/cli` in both `apps/cli` and `packages/cli`.
- Typecheck and build logs missing (possible command or workspace misconfiguration).
- Some imported folders may be empty or missing files (see provenance and git logs).

## 6. Rollback Instructions
- To revert Batch 1 import, use `git log` to find the commit and `git revert <commit>`.
- All provenance and logs are in `reports/consolidation-scout/2025-09-27/` for audit and rollback.

---

## 7. Next Steps
- Review and resolve workspace duplication for `@odavl/cli` (remove or consolidate one of `apps/cli` or `packages/cli`).
- Investigate missing typecheck/build logs and ensure all verification steps are re-run after fixing workspace issues.
- Once clean, proceed to Phase 6: PR & Merge.
