# Import & Usage Analysis – LEGACY/NOISE Files (Wave H2)

## Summary
This report validates the classification of LEGACY/NOISE files from Wave H1 by performing a repository-wide import and usage analysis. The goal is to ensure that no file marked as LEGACY/NOISE is directly or indirectly used in runtime, builds, tests, or CI workflows. If any reference is found, the file is conservatively marked as SAFE-HOLD; otherwise, it is marked as SAFE-REMOVE.

**Result:**
- All LEGACY/NOISE files are only referenced in logs, status, or plan files, not in runtime, build, or test code.
- No direct or indirect usage was found in any config, workflow, or script files that affect runtime, build, or CI.
- All LEGACY/NOISE files are marked as **SAFE-REMOVE**.

## Methodology
- Enumerated all LEGACY/NOISE files from `FILES_NOISE.txt`.
- Searched for references in all config, workflow, and script files, as well as all code and documentation.
- Performed targeted searches for each LEGACY/NOISE file and related patterns (e.g., .turbo/cache/, node_modules/.bin/, .vscode/settings.json, tsconfig.tsbuildinfo, cookies/, $OUT/, antibodies/, coverage/, clover.xml, lcov.info, build.log, lint.log, test.log, typecheck.log).
- Analyzed all matches to determine if any reference was in a runtime, build, or test context.

## Evidence & Findings
- All matches for LEGACY/NOISE files were found in:
  - Hygiene, undo, or immune logs (e.g., `immune-undo.log`, `post-delete-git-status.txt`)
  - Plan, status, or evidence files (e.g., `FILES_LIST.txt`, `FULLSCAN_ALL_IN_ONE.md`)
  - Lint, build, test, and typecheck logs (e.g., `logs/build.log`, `logs/lint.log`, `logs/test.log`, `logs/typecheck.log`)
- No matches were found in any runtime, build, or test code, nor in any config or workflow file that would cause these files to be loaded or executed.
- Example: `.turbo/cookies/` files are only referenced in logs and status files, never imported or required by code.
- Example: `node_modules/.bin/`, `.vscode/settings.json`, and `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` are only mentioned in plan or hygiene reports.

## Table: LEGACY/NOISE File Usage Status
| File/Pattern                  | Usage Reference Found? | SAFE-REMOVE/SAFE-HOLD | Notes |
|------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| .turbo/cache/                | No (logs only)         | SAFE-REMOVE           | Only in hygiene/undo logs |
| .turbo/cookies/              | No (logs only)         | SAFE-REMOVE           | Only in hygiene/undo logs |
| node_modules/.bin/           | No                     | SAFE-REMOVE           | Not referenced |
| .vscode/settings.json        | No (plan/workflow)     | SAFE-REMOVE           | Not loaded by code |
| tsconfig.tsbuildinfo         | No (logs/reports)      | SAFE-REMOVE           | Not loaded by code |
| $OUT/                        | No (docs only)         | SAFE-REMOVE           | Only in documentation |
| antibodies/                  | No (docs only)         | SAFE-REMOVE           | Only in documentation |
| coverage/, clover.xml, lcov.info | No (logs/reports)  | SAFE-REMOVE           | Only in test/coverage logs |
| build.log, lint.log, test.log, typecheck.log | No (logs/reports) | SAFE-REMOVE | Only in logs, not loaded by code |

## Conclusion
All LEGACY/NOISE files are safe to remove. No evidence of runtime, build, test, or CI workflow usage was found. All references are in logs, status, or documentation files only.
