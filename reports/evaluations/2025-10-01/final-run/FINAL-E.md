- All critical CI/CD workflows are present and enforced:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` – Main build, test, lint, doctor, bundle, metrics, security, chaos, canary jobs

- CI runs on all pushes and PRs, with matrix for OS and Node.js versions
- Security, bundle, and observability evidence is archived via CI artifacts


### Automation Evidence

- **Build logs:**
  - [`build/build.log`](./build/build.log)

- **Lint logs:**
  - [`lint/lint.log`](./lint/lint.log)

- **Typecheck logs:**
  - [`typecheck/typecheck.log`](./typecheck/typecheck.log)

- **Doctor/health checks:**
  - [`../doctor/doctor.log`](../doctor/doctor.log)

- **Bundle size evidence:**
  - [`../bundle/bundle.log`](../bundle/bundle.log)

- **Observability/metrics:**
