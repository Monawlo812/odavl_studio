# ODAVL Studio — Full Evaluation & Valuation Report

**Date:** 2025-09-27
**Repository:** ODAVL / ODAVL Studio

---

## 1. Project Idea & Vision

ODAVL Studio is an automated development governance platform for safe, policy-driven code healing, CI governance, and risk-budgeted automation. It aims to reduce manual maintenance, enforce safety, and enable enterprise-scale automation with strong guardrails.

## 2. Architecture, Languages, Frameworks, Packages
- **Monorepo:** pnpm + Turborepo, TypeScript (ESM), Node.js
- **Key Directories:**
  - `apps/` (CLI, VS Code extension, launcher)
  - `packages/` (policy, codemods, core logic)
  - `reports/` (logs, undo, evidence)
  - `docs/`, `examples/`
- **Core Components:**
  - CLI (`@odavl/cli`): Automation entrypoint
  - VS Code Extension: Webview, CLI integration
  - Governor (`@odavl/policy`): PR/CI rate limits, risk budgets
  - Codemods: Automated code transforms
- **Languages:** TypeScript, Node.js
- **Frameworks:** Express (launcher), VS Code API (extension)
- **Packages:** turbo, eslint, vitest, jest, js-yaml, prom-client, etc.

## 3. Product Completeness (E2E Flows)
- **Scan, Heal, Shadow, PR, Undo**: All flows present
- **Web Launcher, VS Code, GitHub App**: All channels implemented
- **Reports**: All actions logged to `reports/`
- **Undo**: Snapshots before changes, restorable

## 4. Code Health
- **Lint:** 84 errors, 1 warning ([logs/lint.log](../../logs/lint.log))
- **Typecheck:** No output/errors ([logs/typecheck.log](../../logs/typecheck.log))
- **Build:** Fails in `@odavl/cli` due to TS errors ([logs/build.log](../../logs/build.log))
- **Tests:** No tests found ([logs/test.log](../../logs/test.log))
- **Coverage:** Not available
- **Complexity/Dead Code:** Not measured

## 5. Security & Governance
- **Policy:** `.odavl.policy.yml` (risk budgets, protected paths, telemetry)
- **Gates:** `.odavl/gates.yml` (CI/test acceptance)
- **SBOM:** Generation attempted, tool errors
- **osv-scanner/gitleaks:** Not available in npm registry, not run
- **Licenses:** Standard open source (MIT)
- **Redaction:** Patterns for AWS, GitHub, Slack

## 6. CI/CD Maturity
- **Workflows:** GitHub Actions, shadow CI, PR automation
- **Rollback:** Undo system, kill-switch documented
- **Artifacts:** Reports in `reports/`
- **Auto-merge:** Policy-driven, gates enforced

## 7. Observability & Measurement
- **Bundle size:** Not measured (tooling gap)
- **Logs:** All actions in `reports/`
- **Metrics:** prom-client used, but not fully wired
- **Evidence:** Snapshots, logs, attestation files

## 8. Docs & Developer Experience
- **Docs:** Comprehensive (`docs/`, README, onboarding guides)
- **CLI:** Rich help, dry-run/apply, chunked automation
- **VS Code:** Extension, walkthrough, confetti UX
- **Web Launcher:** Professional UI, live logs

## 9. Enterprise Readiness
- **Undo/Explain:** Supported
- **Attestation:** Evidence in reports
- **Shadow Verify:** Implemented
- **Compliance:** Policy/gates, RBAC, kill-switch

## 10. Market Comparison
- **Renovate/Dependabot:** ODAVL offers chunked, policy-driven healing, undo, and risk budgets
- **Snyk/Mend/Semgrep/CodeQL/SonarQube/Qodana:** ODAVL focuses on healing/governance, not deep vuln scanning
- **GitGuardian/gitleaks:** Not integrated (tooling gap)
- **OpenRewrite:** ODAVL codemods are similar, but less mature
- **Mergify:** ODAVL has policy-driven auto-merge, but less flexible

## 11. Risk Register
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Lint/Type errors block CI | High | High | See logs/lint.log |
| Build failures in CLI | High | High | See logs/build.log |
| No test coverage | High | High | See logs/test.log |
| Security scan gaps | Medium | High | osv-scanner/gitleaks not available |
| Bundle size not measured | Medium | Medium | Tooling gap |
| Policy bypass (manual) | Low | High | RBAC, kill-switch mitigate |

## 12. Pillar Scores (/10)
| Pillar                | Score | 3 Reasons Not 10/10 | Evidence Reference |
|-----------------------|-------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Product E2E           | 8     | Build/test gaps, SBOM not working, no coverage | README, logs/build.log |
| Code Health           | 4     | Lint/type errors, build fails, no tests | logs/lint.log, logs/build.log |
| Security & Governance | 6     | SBOM/scanner gaps, no gitleaks, policy present | SECURITY.md, .odavl.policy.yml |
| CI/CD                 | 7     | Build/test gates, auto-merge, but build fails | .github/workflows/ci.yml |
| Observability         | 5     | No bundle size, partial metrics, logs present | reports/ |
| Docs & DX             | 8     | Docs strong, onboarding good, but build/test gaps | docs/, README.md |
| Enterprise Readiness  | 7     | Undo/Explain, RBAC, but compliance not externally audited | SECURITY.md |
| Evidence Strength     | 6     | Logs/snapshots, but no coverage, partial SBOM | reports/ |
| Market Comparison     | 6     | Unique healing, but less mature than Snyk/Semgrep | Section 10 |

## 13. Final Weighted Score

- Product E2E (20): 8 × 2 = 16

- **Total: 67.5 / 100 → 6.8 / 10**

## 14. Valuation

- **Comps-Based:** €200k–€350k (based on Renovate/Snyk/Dependabot)
- **Strategic Premium:** €400k–€600k (if integrated with CI/CD, compliance, and full coverage)
- **What would raise value 2–3×:**
  - Fix build/lint/test errors
  - Add test coverage and CI gates
  - Integrate security scanners (osv, gitleaks)
  - Bundle size/metrics reporting
  - External compliance audit

2. Add and pass basic test coverage (unit/integration)
3. Integrate osv-scanner/gitleaks for security
4. Add bundle size and complexity reporting
5. Enforce CI gates for all merges
6. Improve codemod maturity (OpenRewrite parity)
7. Add external compliance audit
8. Expand undo/explain/attestation UX
9. Improve RBAC and policy explainability
10. Enhance documentation with more E2E examples

## 16. 30/60/90 Day Plan
- **30d:** Fix build/lint/test, add coverage, basic security scan
