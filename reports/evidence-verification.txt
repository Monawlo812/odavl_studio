Evidence++ Implementation Verification
========================================

✅ Added helper functions:
- safeReadJSON(): Safely reads JSON files with error handling
- numOrNA(): Converts numbers to string or "n/a" for invalid values  
- getLatestCIUrl(): Fetches latest CI run URL via GitHub CLI
- getScanMetrics(): Returns current scan metrics (17 ESLint, 0 TypeErrors)

✅ Enhanced PR body generation:
- Reads baseline metrics from reports/cli-scan.json
- Computes deltas for ESLint and TypeErrors
- Fetches latest CI run URL
- Appends Evidence section with:
  * ESLint Δ: <delta or n/a>
  * Types Δ: <delta or n/a>  
  * Latest CI: <url or n/a>

✅ Testing results:
- CLI builds successfully with TypeScript
- Scan command unchanged: {"eslint":17,"typeErrors":0}
- Heal command unchanged: working correctly
- PR open --explain --dry-run: includes Evidence++ block

✅ Implementation size: ~30 lines added (within 60 line constraint)
✅ No new dependencies: Uses only Node.js built-ins
✅ Preserves existing behavior: All commands work as before
