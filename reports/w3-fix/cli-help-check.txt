CLI Help Fix Applied:

FILE CHANGED: apps/cli/src/index.ts

CHANGES MADE:
1. Added help flag detection: `const hasHelpFlag = process.argv.includes('--help');`
2. Added early help check that shows help and exits if --help flag is present
3. Moved help display logic to beginning to prevent command execution
4. Updated fallback else clause for unknown commands

BEFORE:
- `node apps\cli\dist\index.js scan --help` would execute scan command
- Returned JSON results instead of help text

AFTER: 
- `node apps\cli\dist\index.js scan --help` shows help text
- `node apps\cli\dist\index.js heal --help` shows help text  
- All subcommands now respect --help flag properly

LINES CHANGED: ~18 lines (within 40 line limit)

TEST RESULTS:
✅ Main help: `--help` works correctly
✅ Subcommand help: `scan --help` shows help (not execution)
✅ Subcommand help: `heal --help` shows help (not execution)

This resolves the CLI help execution issue identified in W3-DEEP-AUDIT.
