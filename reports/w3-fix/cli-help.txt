CLI Help Behavior Analysis:

MAIN COMMAND: ✅ WORKING
- `node apps\cli\dist\index.js --help` shows proper help text
- Lists all 11 commands correctly

SUBCOMMAND HELP: ❌ ISSUE FOUND
- `node apps\cli\dist\index.js scan --help` executes scan instead of showing help
- Returns scan results JSON instead of help text
- This is the CLI help execution issue identified in W3-DEEP-AUDIT

ROOT CAUSE: Subcommand help handlers are executing the command instead of displaying help when --help flag is passed.

NEEDS FIX: apps/cli/src/index.ts - ensure --help flag is handled before action execution
