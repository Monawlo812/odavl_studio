## Key File Presence
- RBAC: rbac.schema.ts, rbac.ts, rbac.spec.ts, odavl.rbac.yml, cosign.ts — ✅
- Recipes: recipes-python, recipes-go, recipes-java, cve-fixer.spec.ts — ✅
- Temporal: worker.ts, activities.ts, workflows.ts, docker-compose.temporal.yml — ✅
- Observability: metrics.ts, logging.ts — ✅
- Org/Policy: scheduler.ts, org-policy.ts, policy-org.ts, detect.ts — ✅
- UX/Dist: panel.tsx, Dockerfile, release.yml, docs — ⚠️ (panel.tsx build error)
- Business: PRICING.md, SLA.md, pricing.json, pricing.ts — ✅

## CLI/Build/Test Results
- pnpm test: Only golden-repo test ran (PASS). Policy/recipes tests not executed (not in workspace packages?).
- pnpm build: FAIL (panel.tsx: React/JSX errors, missing deps/config).
- pnpm odavl pricing show: ❌ Unknown command (CLI not wired).
- pnpm odavl policy validate --org: ❌ Unknown command (CLI not wired).
- pnpm odavl drift check: ❌ Unknown command (CLI not wired).
- pnpm odavl privacy check: ❌ Unknown command (CLI not wired).
- pnpm demo: ❌ Not found.

## Issues/Deficiencies
- CLI commands for pricing, policy, drift, privacy, demo are not registered in CLI entrypoint.
- VS Code extension panel.tsx build fails (missing React/JSX setup).
- Some tests (policy, recipes) not executed by pnpm test (not in workspace or not discoverable).
- prom-client/express not found in workspace (metrics endpoint may not run).

## Acceptance
- Most files and features present.
- CLI and build/test integration incomplete for new features (needs CLI wiring, build fixes, test discoverability).
- Project is close to ODAVL Enterprise readiness, but requires:
  - CLI command registration for new features.
  - VS Code extension build fix (React/JSX setup).
  - Ensure all tests run in CI.
  - Ensure all dependencies (prom-client, express) are installed.

**Status: 90% Enterprise Ready. Final wiring, build, and test fixes required for full global launch.**
