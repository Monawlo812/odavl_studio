# Fix Problems Report – 2025-09-25

## Root Causes Found

- `.github/workflows/freeze.yml`: YAML parsing errors due to indentation and misplaced keys in steps (lines ~52–107)
- `apps/vscode-ext/package.json`: Duplicate `main` property, redundant activation event for current `engines.vscode`
- `scripts/metrics/bundle.mjs`: Nested ternary for command selection (readability)
- `scripts/learn/outcomes.mjs`: Unused import
- `apps/vscode-ext/src/services/cli.ts`: Regex hygiene (use `\d` instead of `[0-9]`, remove control chars)
- `apps/vscode-ext/src/commands/undo.ts`: Unused import
- `apps/vscode-ext/src/commands/runCodemod.ts`: Useless assignment/const
- `apps/vscode-ext/src/extension.ts`: Use `let`/`const` instead of `var`
- `apps/vscode-ext/src/doctor/selector.ts`: Optional chaining/nested ternary readability
- `apps/vscode-ext/src/doctor/runner.ts`: Optional chaining/nested ternary readability
