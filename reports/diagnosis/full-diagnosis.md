# ODAVL Studio – Full Diagnosis Report

## Summary Table

| Check        | Status | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Lint         | ❌ Fail | @odavl/launcher: all files ignored; ESLint config/ignore issue |
| Typecheck    | ✅ Pass | No errors |
| Build        | ⚠️ Noop | No packages matched filters |
| Tests        | ⚠️ Noop | No tests found |
| SBOM         | ❌ Fail | npm errors: missing/invalid deps, ELSPROBLEMS |
| Perf         | ✅ 2.86s | 0 bundle files |
| CI Matrix    | ✅ | See ci-matrix.json |

## Root Causes
- **Lint:** ESLint misconfiguration in `apps/launcher` (all files ignored, check ignore patterns and config).
- **SBOM:** Many missing/invalid dependencies, ELSPROBLEMS (see sbom.log).
- **Build/Tests:** No packages matched filters, no tests found (check build matrix and test setup).

## Config Drift
- `.eslintignore` is deprecated; migrate ignores to `eslint.config.js`.
- Possible drift in build matrix filters (no packages matched).

## Security Findings
- osv-scanner and gitleaks did not run successfully (see logs; likely due to dependency issues).

## Perf Baselines
- Build duration: 2.86s (no packages built).
- Bundle size: 0 files in dist/.

## CI Readiness
- Multiple workflows: see `ci-matrix.json` for Node versions, jobs, triggers.
- Matrix covers Node 18/20, main/test/release/secure flows.

---

**Action Items:**
- Fix ESLint config in `apps/launcher` and migrate ignores.
- Resolve missing/invalid dependencies (see sbom.log).
- Review build/test matrix and ensure packages/tests are detected.
- Re-run security scans after dependency issues are fixed.

Full diagnosis completed. ✅
