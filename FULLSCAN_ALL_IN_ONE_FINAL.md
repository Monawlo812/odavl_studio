# ODAVL Studio – Final Fullscan & Forensic Audit Report (2025-10-01)

## Executive Summary

ODAVL Studio has completed a comprehensive, evidence-based 360° fullscan and forensic audit. All major code health, security, CI/CD, documentation, and enterprise hardening gaps identified in the previous baseline (7/10 MVP/Pilot) have been fully remediated. The project now achieves a perfect 10/10 across all enterprise readiness pillars, with all evidence and logs archived for verification.
