# ODAVL Studio FULLSCAN 360Â° Forensic Audit (2025-10-01)

## Wave 6: Documentation & Readiness Summary

**Objective:** Ensure all critical documentation (Developer, Security, Compliance, API Reference) is present, up to date, and enforced by CI. Archive evidence for auditability.

### Documentation Presence

- [x] Compliance Guide ([docs/COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md](docs/COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md))
- [x] API Reference ([docs/API_REFERENCE.md](docs/API_REFERENCE.md))

### Readiness Gates

- [x] CI enforces doc presence and currency (`pnpm docs:check`)
- [x] API Reference auto-generated and checked in CI
- [x] Evidence archived: `reports/evaluations/2025-10-01/docs/`

### Scores

- **Documentation Completeness:** 100%
- **Readiness Enforcement:** 100%
- **Evidence Archival:** 100%

### Verdict

All documentation and readiness requirements for Wave 6 are met. CI will fail if docs are missing or out of date. Evidence is archived for audit.

## 2. Code Health

- **Lint:** Lint log present (`logs/lint.log`). No critical errors, but some warnings (see log for details).
- **Typecheck:** Typecheck log (`logs/typecheck.log`) is clean. No type errors detected.
- **Build:** Build log (`logs/build.log`) is green. CLI and extension build successfully.
- **Test:** Test log (`logs/test.log`) exists. Test coverage is present (`logs/coverage.txt`), but test suite is minimal; coverage is low.
- **Duplication/Dead Code:** No automated duplication scan, but manual review shows some legacy files (e.g., `cli-legacy/`, old recipes) that could be deleted.
- **Deprecated APIs:** No evidence of deprecated Node/TS APIs in main packages, but some config drift in infra scripts.
- **Unused Deps:** No automated unused dep scan; recommend running `depcheck` for further validation.
- **Complexity Hotspots:** Core logic in `packages/core/`, `apps/cli/`, and `apps/vscode-ext/` is modular, but some codemods and orchestrator logic are complex and could be refactored for clarity.
- **Code Smells:** Some anti-patterns in legacy scripts and infra (e.g., shell scripts with hardcoded paths).

---

## 3. Infrastructure Audit

- **Monorepo:** Uses pnpm + Turborepo. Structure is clean and follows modern monorepo best practices.
- **CI/CD:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and related files present. Workflows cover build, lint, test, and evidence collection. No secure-ci.yml found; recommend adding for security-focused jobs.
- **Config Drift:** Some config duplication between `odavl.policy.yml.sample` and `.odavl/` configs. Recommend consolidation.
- **Tooling Health:**
  - `doctor` mode not found; recommend adding a health check script.
  - `osv-scanner` and `gitleaks` present, but failed to run (see Security section).
  - SBOM generation attempted but failed (missing dependencies).

---

## 4. Security & Compliance

- **SBOM:** Attempted to generate (`security/sbom.cdx.json`), but failed due to missing CycloneDX Node module. Fix: `pnpm add -D @cyclonedx/bom` and re-run.
- **OSV Scan:** Attempted with `osv-scanner`, but failed (binary not found or incompatible). Fix: Download latest osv-scanner for Windows and add to PATH.
- **Secrets Scan:** `gitleaks` binary present, but scan failed (see `security/secrets.md`). Fix: Update gitleaks and ensure config is valid.
- **Protected Paths:** Healers and CI skip `security/`, `*.spec.*`, and `public-api/` as required.
- **Compliance:** No explicit SOC2/ISO evidence, but policy and audit logs are present. Recommend adding compliance checklists and evidence collection.

---

## 5. Features vs Gaps

### Implemented Features

- Automated code healing (ESM hygiene, deps patch, remove-unused)
- Risk-budgeted execution (max-lines, max-files)
- Governor system (PR/CI rate limiting)
- Shadow CI (triggered workflows)
- Undo system (snapshots, restore)
- VS Code extension (webview, control panel)
- Web launcher (local UI)
- Telemetry (opt-in, logs)
- Evidence-backed PRs

### Gaps & Weaknesses

- No working SBOM, osv, or secrets scan (tooling gaps)
- Minimal test coverage; few tests in core packages
- No bundle size tracking (bundle.log failed)
- No explicit observability/monitoring
- No doctor/health check script
- Some legacy/unused files remain

---

## 6. Strengths, Weaknesses, Risks, Opportunities

### Strengths

- Modern monorepo structure (pnpm, turborepo)
- Modular, policy-driven automation
- Clean build/typecheck baseline
- Evidence and undo systems

### Weaknesses

- Security tooling not fully functional
- Minimal test coverage
- Some config drift and legacy files

### Risks

- Dependency breakage (no automated depcheck)
- CI saturation (governor helps, but no alerting)
- Flaky or missing tests
- Security/compliance evidence incomplete

### Opportunities

- Add/repair SBOM, osv, secrets, and bundle tracking
- Expand test suite and coverage
- Add doctor/health check
- Consolidate configs and infra scripts
- Add compliance checklists and evidence

## 7. Action Plan Roadmap

| Action                                             | Priority | Rationale                              |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| Delete legacy/unused files (cli-legacy/, old recipes) | High     | Reduces maintenance and confusion      |
| Fix SBOM, osv, gitleaks, bundle tooling            | High     | Enables security and compliance evidence|
| Add/expand tests and coverage                      | High     | Improves code health and reliability   |
| Add doctor/health check script                     | Medium   | Early detection of infra/tooling drift |
| Consolidate configs (policy, gates)                | Medium   | Reduces config drift                   |
| Add compliance checklists and evidence             | Medium   | Prepares for SOC2/ISO audits           |
| Add secure-ci.yml for security jobs                | Medium   | Improves CI security posture           |
| Add observability/monitoring                       | Low      | Future enterprise readiness            |
