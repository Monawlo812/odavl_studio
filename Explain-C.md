# Explain-C.md — Stage C: CLI Skeleton

## What changed
<<<<<<< HEAD

Added `apps/cli/bin/odavl.js` (~8 lines): Node shebang, delegates to `../dist/index.js` or prints help if missing
Added `apps/cli/src/index.ts` (~20 lines): Stubs for status, verify, scan, heal commands
Added `apps/cli/tsconfig.json` (~6 lines): Minimal TypeScript config for CLI
Edited `package.json`: Added `build:cli` and `typecheck` scripts

## Why

Implements Stage C of ODAVL/ODAVL Studio MVP as per provided specs
Establishes CLI entrypoint and stub commands for future automation
Ensures build/typecheck scripts are present for CI and developer use

## Risk

Lines: ~36 (all infra/config, no code logic)
Files: 4
Protected paths touched: 0
No user-facing or runtime risk; all changes are additive

## Verify

`pnpm run build:cli` and `pnpm run typecheck` now work for CLI
CLI stubs respond to status, verify, scan, heal commands

## Next step

Commit as "chore(odavl): stage C — CLI skeleton"
Push branch and prepare for Stage D (VS Code extension panel)
