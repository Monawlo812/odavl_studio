# Explain-D.md — Stage D: VS Code Extension Minimal Panel

## What changed
<<<<<<< HEAD

 Added `odavl.scanHeal` command and activation event to `apps/vscode-ext/package.json` (minimal, non-breaking)
 Added `studio:build` script to root `package.json` for extension build passthrough
 No other files or features changed; all existing extension logic and UI remain intact

## Why

 Implements Stage D of ODAVL/ODAVL Studio MVP as per provided specs
 Enables a minimal Scan/Heal panel command for future UI wiring
 Ensures build script is available for workspace-level automation

## Risk

 Lines: +4 (all infra/config, no code logic)
 Files: 2
 Protected paths touched: 0
 No user-facing or runtime risk; all changes are additive and non-breaking

## Verify

 VS Code extension now exposes `odavl.scanHeal` command (stub)
 `pnpm run studio:build` works for extension build
 All other extension features remain functional

## Next step

 Commit as "feat(studio): stage D — minimal VS Code panel"
 Push branch and prepare for Stage E (codemod stub)
