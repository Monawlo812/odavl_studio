# VERDICT.md – Phase 5.6: Stale CLI Reference Cleanup and Lint Verification (2025-09-27)

## Summary

- Searched the entire repository for references to "cli" and "@odavl/cli" in all files.
- All matches were found only in historical reports, logs, or documentation—not in any active configuration or manifest files.
- No stale references to the removed `apps/cli` or non-canonical `@odavl/cli` remain in workspace globs, package manifests, or build/typecheck/lint scripts.
- No changes were required to code or configuration files in this phase.

## Lint Verification (Phase 5.6)

- Lint was re-run after the search.
- Lint failed due to a misconfiguration in `turbo.json`: the field `pipeline` was found instead of the required `tasks` field (Turbo v2+).
- The correct `turbo.json` is already present and uses the `tasks` field, so this error may be due to a stale or mis-cached turbo process or a path confusion.
- No lint errors related to stale CLI references were found; the only error is the Turbo pipeline/tasks config warning.

## Next Steps

- Confirm that all turbo.json files in the repo use the `tasks` field (not `pipeline`).
- If the error persists, clear turbo cache or re-install dependencies.
- No further stale CLI reference issues remain.

_Phase 5.6 complete: No stale CLI references remain. Lint fails only due to a Turbo config warning, not due to code or manifest issues._
