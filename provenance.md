## Phase 5.6 – Stale CLI Reference Search (2025-09-27)

- Searched the entire repository for references to "cli" and "@odavl/cli" in all files.
- All matches were found only in historical reports, logs, or documentation—not in any active configuration or manifest files.
- No stale references to the removed `apps/cli` or non-canonical `@odavl/cli` remain in workspace globs, package manifests, or build/typecheck/lint scripts.
- No changes were required to code or configuration files in this phase.
- Next: Lint verification will be re-run and results will be logged in VERDICT.md.
